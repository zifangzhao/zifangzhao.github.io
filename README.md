### About myself

I’m a post-doc scientist work in the interdisciplinary field of Neuroscience/Electric Engineering. In my line of work, I’m focusing on developing neural interface technologies and translate those technology to advance neuroscience researches.

My past works have been focused on developing electrophysiology-related technologies for neural disorders like epilepsy and pathologic pain. Those work including algorithm development for neural data(Z.-F. Zhao, Li, and Wan 2017), recording technology development facilitates the study of pain(Ma et al. 2019; Li et al. 2017), and the clinical translation of those technology(Khodagholy et al. 2016).  In our recent work (Z. Zhao et al. 2021), we have demonstrated an implantable closed-loop neural interface system with a novel multiplex-then-amplify (MTA) structure. In short, MTA structure provides a high channel-count, low power-consumption bidirectional neural interface. We have developed an implantable wireless closed-loop neural interface based on this MTA structure that is capable of wireless recording of high-quality electrophysiology data, delivery of effective electrical stimulation to all channels, and performance of closed-loop stimulation with an onboard digital signal processor. Preliminary results showed that closed-loop low-frequency stimulation to mPFC could decouple mPFC spindles from hippocampal IEDs in kindled animals, offering the possibility of preventing the development of aberrant functional connectivity between these structures.
